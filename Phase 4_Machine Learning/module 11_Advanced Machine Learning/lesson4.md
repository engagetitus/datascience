Lesson 4: Reinforcement Learning

**Objective:** Learn about reinforcement learning and how to apply it to problems involving sequential decision-making.

#### Key Topics:
- **Definition:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) involves training agents to make decisions by rewarding desirable actions and punishing undesirable ones.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Markov Decision Processes (MDP):** Framework for modeling RL problems with states, actions, and rewards.
  - **Algorithms:**
    - **Q-Learning:** Model-free algorithm to learn the value of actions.
    - **Policy Gradient Methods:** Techniques to optimize the policy directly.
    - **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Combining Q-learning with deep learning for complex environments.
  - **Applications:** Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics, and recommendation systems.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python Libraries:** `gym`, `stable-baselines3`, `tensorflow`
- **Examples:** Training an RL agent for simple games like CartPole or custom environments.
