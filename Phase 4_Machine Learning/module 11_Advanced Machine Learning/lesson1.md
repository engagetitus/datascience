### Lesson 1: Feature Engineering

**Objective:** Understand the importance of feature engineering and learn techniques to create and select features for improving model performance.

#### Key Topics:
- **Definition:** Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Feature Selection:** Choosing the most relevant features for the model. Techniques include Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), LASSO, and feature importance from models.
  - **Feature Extraction:** Transforming raw data into meaningful features. Methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and autoencoders.
  - **Feature Creation:** Generating new features based on existing data. Examples include polynomial features, interaction terms, and domain-specific features.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python Libraries:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `feature-engine`
- **Examples:** Feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values.
