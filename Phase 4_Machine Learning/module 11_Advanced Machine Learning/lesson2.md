### Lesson 2: Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

**Objective:** Learn how to choose the best model for a given problem and fine-tune its hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

#### Key Topics:
- **Model Selection:**
  - **Cross-Validation:** Techniques such as k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
  - **Model Comparison:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to compare different models.
  - **Grid Search and Random Search:** Methods for systematically searching through hyperparameter space.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - **Definition:** Adjusting model parameters that are not learned from the data to improve model performance.
  - **Techniques:** Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Hyperband.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `Optuna`, `Hyperopt`
- **Examples:** Tuning parameters for models like SVMs, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
