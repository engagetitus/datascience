### Lesson 3: NoSQL Databases

**Objective:** Explore NoSQL databases, their use cases, and how they differ from traditional SQL databases.

#### Key Topics:
- **Types of NoSQL Databases:**
  - **Document-Oriented:** Store data in document formats. Examples include MongoDB and CouchDB.
  - **Column-Family Stores:** Store data in columns rather than rows. Examples include Cassandra and HBase.
  - **Key-Value Stores:** Store data as key-value pairs. Examples include Redis and DynamoDB.
  - **Graph Databases:** Store data in graph structures. Examples include Neo4j and ArangoDB.
- **Use Cases:** When to use NoSQL over SQL, such as for unstructured data, high scalability, and flexible schemas.
- **Data Modeling:** Designing schemas for NoSQL databases, including denormalization and aggregation.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python Libraries:** `pymongo`, `cassandra-driver`, `redis-py`
- **Examples:** Working with MongoDB collections, Cassandra tables, and Redis data.
