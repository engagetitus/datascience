### Lesson 3: Ensemble Learning

**Objective:** Understand ensemble methods and their benefits for improving model accuracy and robustness.

#### Key Topics:
- **Definition:** Ensemble learning combines multiple models to produce a stronger model. It leverages the strengths of individual models to improve overall performance.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Bagging:** Bootstrap Aggregating (e.g., Random Forests) to reduce variance and improve accuracy.
  - **Boosting:** Methods like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to reduce bias and improve prediction.
  - **Stacking:** Combining predictions from multiple models (base learners) using a meta-model to improve performance.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`
- **Examples:** Implementing Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), and stacking classifiers.
