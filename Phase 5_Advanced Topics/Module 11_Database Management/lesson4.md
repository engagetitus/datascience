### Lesson 4: Database Performance Tuning

**Objective:** Understand techniques for optimizing the performance of databases to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

#### Key Topics:
- **Indexing:** Creating indexes to speed up query performance.
- **Query Optimization:** Analyzing and improving slow queries using execution plans.
- **Database Normalization and Denormalization:** Techniques to optimize database design for performance and data integrity.
- **Caching:** Using caching mechanisms to reduce database load and improve access speed.
- **Sharding and Replication:** Techniques for distributing data across multiple servers to improve scalability and reliability.

#### Tools and Libraries:
- **Python Libraries:** `sqlalchemy`, `redis-py`
- **Examples:** Implementing indexes in SQL databases, configuring caching strategies in NoSQL databases.
